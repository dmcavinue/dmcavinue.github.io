It's something that's been troubling me for a while.  While I'm calling this 'degoogling', this isn't necessarily a dig at google itself but more that I depend too much on Google services and want to diversify things a bit.  I doubt Google have any intentions of killing any of the services I rely on but they do have a general trend of [killing services](https://killedbygoogle.com/) that I would like to avoid.   My loose goal has been to reduce this dependency over time by finding viable alternatives.  Along the way, I need to find that fine line of comfort between managed services and self hosting.  Usually, their is a cost attached to this endeavor, I have to be okay with losing some of these functions.  These services (gmail, google photos, etc) that are 'free' really do usually have a great user experience and functionality at that price tag of your data and I need to be okay with that.

The core services I need to find alternatives for are:
- **Email**: *Gmail*
- **Calendar**: *Google Calendar*
- **Photos**: *Google Photos*
- **Storage**: *Google Drive*
- **Maps**: *Google Maps*
- **Notes**: *Google Notes/Evernote*
- **Phone**: *Android*

As you can see, a scary over-dependence on google services.
